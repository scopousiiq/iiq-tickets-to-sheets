# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Google Apps Script project for extracting IncidentIQ (IIQ) ticket and SLA data into Google Sheets. The data is used for Power BI consumption and analytics dashboards. This is not a Node.js project - it's Google Apps Script (.gs files) that runs within Google Sheets.

## Architecture

```
IIQ API  →  Google Apps Script  →  Google Sheets  →  Power BI
           (scripts/*.gs)         (formula-based     (consumption)
                                   analytics)
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Scripts fetch data from IIQ API using Bearer token authentication
2. Raw data lands in `TicketData` sheet (35 columns including consolidated SLA metrics)
3. Analytics sheets (`MonthlyVolume`, `BacklogAging`, `TeamWorkload`, etc.) calculate via Google Sheets formulas - no scripts needed
4. Power BI connects to Google Sheets for dashboards

**Year Discovery (Tickets):**
- Years are auto-discovered from Config sheet keys (no code changes needed)
- Historical years: `TICKET_{YEAR}_LAST_PAGE` rows → pagination-based loading
- Current year: `TICKET_{YEAR}_LAST_FETCH` row → date windowing for incremental updates

**Consolidated SLA Data:**
- SLA metrics are fetched per-batch during ticket loading (single API call per batch)
- No separate SLA loading phase - SLA is always in sync with ticket data
- Columns 29-35: ResponseThreshold, ResponseActual, ResponseBreach, ResolutionThreshold, ResolutionActual, ResolutionBreach, IsRunning

## Code Structure (scripts/)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Setup.gs` | Initial spreadsheet setup - creates all sheets, headers, and formulas |
| `Config.gs` | Reads settings from Config sheet, year discovery via regex, logging utilities |
| `ApiClient.gs` | HTTP client with retry/exponential backoff (429, 503, network errors) |
| `TicketData.gs` | Bulk ticket loader - 35 columns (28 ticket + 7 SLA), fetches SLA per-batch, year-based pagination, 5.5min timeout with resume |
| `SlaCompliance.gs` | SLA compliance analytics - reads from consolidated TicketData to calculate monthly breach rates and avg response/resolution times |
| `Teams.gs` | Team directory loader, preserves Functional Area mappings |
| `DailySnapshot.gs` | Captures daily backlog metrics (cannot be calculated retroactively) |
| `Menu.gs` | Creates "IIQ Data" menu in Google Sheets |
| `Triggers.gs` | Time-driven trigger functions (no UI dialogs) |

**Key Dependencies:**
- `ApiClient.gs` → `Config.gs`
- All data loaders → `ApiClient.gs`
- `DailySnapshot.gs` reads from `TicketData` sheet (not API)

## Key Patterns

**Pagination with Timeout Handling:**
```javascript
const MAX_RUNTIME_MS = 5.5 * 60 * 1000; // Stay under 6min Apps Script limit
while (Date.now() - startTime < MAX_RUNTIME_MS) {
  // Process one batch, save progress to Config sheet
  // User runs "Continue Loading" to resume
}
```

**Year-Based Loading (Tickets with SLA):**
- Historical years: Standard pagination (`TICKET_{YEAR}_LAST_PAGE`)
- Current year: Date windowing (`TICKET_{YEAR}_LAST_FETCH`) for incremental updates
- Each batch: Fetch tickets → Fetch SLA for those ticket IDs → Merge → Write to sheet

**Per-Batch SLA Fetching:**
```javascript
// After fetching ticket batch:
const ticketIds = tickets.map(t => t.TicketId);
const slaMap = fetchSlaForTicketIds(ticketIds); // Single API call
const rows = tickets.map(t => extractTicketRow(t, now, year, slaMap));
```

**Rate Limiting:**
- Exponential backoff: 2s base, doubles on retry (up to 3 retries)
- Configurable throttle via `THROTTLE_MS` in Config sheet

## Sheets Overview

| AA-AB | Requester: RequesterId, RequesterName |
| AC-AI | SLA Metrics: ResponseThreshold, ResponseActual, ResponseBreach, ResolutionThreshold, ResolutionActual, ResolutionBreach, IsRunning |

## Google Apps Script Notes

- No `package.json` or npm - this is Apps Script, not Node.js
- Deploy via Extensions > Apps Script in Google Sheets
- API reference: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference
- 6-minute execution limit per invocation
- `UrlFetchApp.fetch()` for HTTP, `SpreadsheetApp` for sheet operations
- `Utilities.sleep()` for delays (required for rate limiting)

## Initial Setup (New Spreadsheet)

1. Create a new Google Spreadsheet
2. Go to Extensions > Apps Script
3. Copy all `.gs` files from the `scripts/` directory
4. Save and refresh the spreadsheet
5. Run **IIQ Data > Setup > Setup Spreadsheet** to create all sheets
6. Fill in **Config** sheet with API credentials:
   - `API_BASE_URL`: Your IIQ instance URL
   - `BEARER_TOKEN`: JWT authentication token
   - `SITE_ID`: Optional site UUID
7. Configure year tracking rows (e.g., `TICKET_2024_LAST_PAGE`, `TICKET_2025_LAST_FETCH`)
8. Run **IIQ Data > Setup > Verify Configuration** to check settings
9. Run **IIQ Data > Refresh Teams** to load team directory
10. Run **IIQ Data > Ticket Data > Continue Loading** to start loading data

## Testing Changes

1. Open the Google Sheet linked to this project
2. Go to Extensions > Apps Script
3. Copy updated `.gs` file content
4. Save and run the function manually or via the IIQ Data menu
5. Check the `Logs` sheet for operation results

## Trigger Setup (Optimized for Freshness + Efficiency)

| Function | Schedule | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `triggerDataContinue` | Every 10 min | Continue any in-progress loading (initial OR open refresh) |
| `triggerOpenTicketRefresh` | Every 2 hours | Start open ticket + SLA refresh |
| `triggerNewTickets` | Every 30 min | Fetch newly created tickets (fast incremental check) |
| `triggerDailySnapshot` | Daily 7:00 PM | Capture backlog metrics for trending |
| `triggerWeeklyFullRefresh` | Weekly Sun 2 AM | Full reload to catch deletions/corrections |

**Data Freshness:**
- Open ticket SLA data: max 2 hours stale
- New tickets: appear within 30 minutes
- Status changes: captured within 2 hours
- Deletions/corrections: captured weekly

**The `triggerDataContinue` Trigger:**
This is the "keep things moving" trigger. It serves two purposes:
1. **Initial load not complete**: Continues loading historical ticket data
2. **Open refresh in progress**: Continues open ticket refresh if it timed out
3. **Both complete**: Does nothing (safe to leave enabled permanently)

**Ongoing Operations:**
1. **Open Ticket Refresh** (every 2 hours): Primary refresh mechanism
   - Fetches all open tickets with fresh SLA metrics
   - Fetches tickets closed in last 7 days (STALE_DAYS config)
   - Updates existing rows IN PLACE (efficient, no delete/recreate)
   - If timeout occurs, `triggerDataContinue` continues it

2. **New Tickets** (every 30 min): Fast incremental check
   - Uses date windowing from last fetch timestamp
   - Very fast - typically 0-50 new tickets

3. **Weekly Full Refresh** (Sunday 2 AM): Catch edge cases
   - Preserves historical data (2+ years old)
   - Clears and reloads recent years
   - Catches deleted tickets, data corrections

**Historical Data Preservation:**
- Weekly refresh preserves data from (currentYear - 2) and older
- Example: In 2026, data from 2024 is preserved; only 2025-2026 reload
- Uses efficient filter-and-rewrite (not row deletion)

## Config Sheet Keys

Required:
- `API_BASE_URL`: IIQ instance URL (e.g., `https://district.incidentiq.com/api`)
- `BEARER_TOKEN`: JWT authentication token
- `SITE_ID`: Site UUID (if required)

Optional:
- `PAGE_SIZE`: Records per API call (default 100)
- `THROTTLE_MS`: Delay between requests (default 1000)
- `TICKET_BATCH_SIZE`: Tickets per page for bulk load (default 2000)
- `STALE_DAYS`: Days to look back for recently closed tickets (default 7)
- `SLA_RISK_PERCENT`: Percentage threshold for SLA risk warnings (default 75)

Progress Tracking (managed automatically):
- `TICKET_{YEAR}_LAST_PAGE`, `TICKET_{YEAR}_COMPLETE`: Historical year loading progress
- `TICKET_{YEAR}_LAST_FETCH`: Current year incremental sync timestamp
- `OPEN_REFRESH_DATE`: Date of current open ticket refresh
- `OPEN_REFRESH_OPEN_PAGE`, `OPEN_REFRESH_OPEN_COMPLETE`: Open ticket refresh progress
- `OPEN_REFRESH_CLOSED_PAGE`, `OPEN_REFRESH_CLOSED_COMPLETE`: Recently closed refresh progress
